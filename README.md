Get Elm 0.17 from http://elm-lang.org/

`elm.pdf` - my presentation from lecture

`Homework.md` - your homework

`./src/`
* `empty.elm` - empty Elm program template
* `source.elm` - program I've shown you during my presentation
* `ball.elm` - stub for your homework

To run this, install Elm 0.17, clone this repo, navigate to it in your command
line and run `elm reactor`. Then you can go to url it prints to play with those
programs.

If you want to do your homework from scratch, here's how to set up dependencies:
```
elm package install elm-lang/html
elm package install evancz/elm-graphics
elm package install elm-lang/animation-frame
```
